it _SEEMED_ that crime _DECREASED_ when a random selection of people were imprisoned
more _SPECIALJOBSPL_ were needed in the prison, so the AI arrested some _SPECIALJOBSPL_
if _SPECIALJOBSPL_ didn't have enough work in the prison, they were hired out by the AI to a neighboring country. The AI kept the earnings
_PERSON.NAME_ _PERSON.SURNAME_, one of the _SPECIALJOBSPL_, had never committed a crime in _PERSON.HISHER_ life yet was forced to work in the prison industry
the GDP of the country was _INCREASING_ due to the _INCREASE_ in the amount of work happening
people in the prisons were feeling _MISERABLE_ and were _ALLOWED_ only to work
it had been a long time since _PERSON.NAME_ _PERSON.SURNAME_ had seen a _ROADSTUFF_
_PERSON.NAME_ _PERSON.SURNAME_ wished that _PERSON.HESHE_ could be at a _LANDFORMS_ - or anywhere other than the prison
the very idea of anyone going to a _PLACES_ seemed _UNBELIEVABLE_ now
