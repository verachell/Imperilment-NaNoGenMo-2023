## Usage - how to run this program

Please note: As a prerequisite, this code requires that:

- `ruby` is installed on your machine (I used Ruby v 3.2.2 for this) and

- you have the `yeetwords.rb` file from the YeetWords repository (see below for where to get it and place it - I used YeetWords v 1.2.1 for this).

To run this science fiction satire, first download the contents of this repository into your working directory. You will also need to download the `yeetwords.rb` file from the [YeetWords repository](https://github.com/verachell/YeetWords).

Then in your command line, type `ruby yeetwords.rb imperilment.txt`

A file containing the >50000 words story will be generated in Markdown format. 

## Overview
This generated story consists of 3 alternating timelines:

1. one that was set in 2015 which features an image recognition AI

2. one in 2024 which features a self driving car

3. one in a future in 2031 where society entrusts AI with judicial decisions

This is not a case where the story's very plot comes seemingly out of nowhere, but rather where the rhetoric and repetition necessary for this satire is filled in by the algorithm according to the "bones" of the template. This template is written in YeetWords.
